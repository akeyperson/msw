## üîÅ Model Lifecycle & Security Touchpoints

| Phase            | Key Risks                           | Security Activities                       |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Training         | Data leakage, poisoning              | Validation, secure sourcing                |
| Serialization    | Malicious code in model files        | ClamAV, PickleScan, ModelScan              |
| Deployment       | API exposure, inference misuse       | Auth control, Fortify, SAST tools          |
| Inference        | Prompt injection, model drift        | Input filtering, audit logging             |
| Agentic Use      | Autonomy, hallucination, jailbreaks  | Governance via MCP, logging, testing       |
| A2A Execution    | Unchecked escalation or logic loops  | Delegated policy, tool use boundaries      |
